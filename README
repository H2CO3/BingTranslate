How to compile this (dummy):
----------------------------
Compile as a framework for iOS (thus, without modification, it works only on jailbroken devices. However, with a small modification of the Makefile and your project, the code can be easily incorporated in any, even AppStore app):

mobile@iPhone ~ $ git clone git://github.com/H2CO3/BingTranslate
mobile@iPhone ~ $ cd BingTranslate
mobile@iPhone ~ $ sudo make

The last command only works if the proper directory structure is set up on the device beforehands. See Makefile for details.
Make sure to create and copy the appropriate files to /System/Library/Frameworks/BingTranslate.framework

How to use this:
----------------
Go ahead to http://www.microsoft.com/web/post/using-the-free-bing-translation-apis or http://www.bing.com/developers/appids.aspx to obtain an App ID. Then create instances of BTClient and start making translate and speech requests.
Note that the BTClientDelegate protocol lists all methods as required so you'll need to implement all of them if your delegate is non-NULL.

@interface Whatever: NSObject <BTClientDelegate> {
	BTClient *client;
}

@implementation Whatever

- (id) init {
	self = [super init];
	client = [[BTClient alloc] initWithAppID:@"0123456789abcdefqwerty"];
	client.delegate = self;
	return self;
}

- (void) dealloc {
	[client release];
	[super dealloc];
}

- (void) randomMethod {
	[client translateText:@"Hello World!" toLanguage:@"fr"];
}

- (void) obscurelyNamedMethod {
	[client translateArray:[NSArray arrayWithObject:@"What's the point of a 1-element array?"] toLanguage:@"it"];
}

- (void) shoutingMethod {
	[client speakText:@"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers." inLanguage:@"en"]; // LOL
}

- (void) bingTranslateClient:(BTClient *)client translatedText:(NSString *)text translation:(NSString *)translation {
	NSLog(@"If Bing is right, then (@% == %@) == true.", text, translation);
}

- (void) bingTranslateClient:(BTClient *)client translatedArray:(NSArray *)array translations:(NSArray *)translations {
	for (int i = 0; i < [array count]; i++) {
		NSDictionary *dict = [translations objectAtIndex:i];
		NSLog(@"'%@' in %@ means '%@'", [array objectAtIndex:i], [dict objectForKey:BTResultKeySourceLanguage], [dict objectForKey:BTResultKeyTransaltion]]);
}

- (void) bingTranslateClient:(BTClient *)client willStartSpeakingText:(NSString *)text inLanguage:(NSString *)language {
	// do stuff
}

- (void) bingTranslateClientFinishedSpeaking:(BTClient *)client {
	// do stuff again
}

- (void) bingTranslateClient:(BTClient *)client errorOccurred:(NSError *)error {
	// freak out user with an obfuscated error message
}
